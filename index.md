# Oliver Wang

I’m an Electrical Engineering B.S. candidate at UCLA (expected June 2026) working on time series forecasting, spectral signal analysis, and efficient ML systems for sensing and embedded deployment. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## What I work on
- Reliability and model selection for time series forecasting via spectral predictability and related frequency domain metrics :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- Efficient architectures for edge deployment, including state space style models and hardware minded evaluation :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- Applied sensing systems spanning radar vital signs, audio, and low cost healthcare imaging :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  

## Selected work
- **Spectral Predictability for model selection (AAAI AI4TS 2026 Workshop)**  
  Paper on spectral predictability as a fast reliability indicator for time series model selection.
