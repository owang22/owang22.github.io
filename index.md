# Oliver Wang

I’m an Electrical Engineering B.S. candidate at UCLA (expected June 2026) working on time series forecasting, spectral signal analysis, and efficient ML systems for sensing and embedded deployment. 

## What I work on
- Reliability and model selection for time series forecasting via spectral predictability and related frequency domain metrics 
- Efficient architectures for edge deployment, including state space style models and hardware minded evaluation 
- Applied sensing systems spanning radar vital signs, audio, and low cost healthcare imaging 

## Selected work
- **Spectral Predictability for model selection (AAAI AI4TS 2026 Workshop)**  
  Paper on spectral predictability as a fast reliability indicator for time series model selection.

- **Edge AI Sensor System (FPGA audio classifier)**  
  Built real time audio processing and visualization and deployed an instrument classifier to Xilinx FPGA hardware.  

## Research
- **Networked and Embedded Systems Laboratory (NESL), UCLA** (Jan 2024 to Present)  
  Frequency domain methods in foundation models for forecasting, plus efficiency work for edge devices and applications in finance and radar vital signs. 

- **Ozcan Research Group, UCLA** (Mar 2023 to Sep 2024)  
  Compact glucose sensing via phosphorescence lifetime imaging with ML for segmentation and variability reduction.
